# 🎮 Outsider: Cosmic Council - Deployment Summary

## ✅ What's Been Set Up

### 📁 Files Created for Netlify Deployment

1. **`netlify.toml`** - Netlify configuration
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `dist`
   - SPA redirect rules
   - Security headers
   - Cache configuration

2. **`.env`** - Local environment (already configured for local server)
   - Contains: `VITE_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8080`
   - ⚠️ **Not committed to Git** (in `.gitignore`)

3. **`.gitignore`** - Updated to exclude environment files

   - `NETLIFY_DEPLOYMENT.md` - Comprehensive deployment guide
   - `MULTIPLAYER_SETUP.md` - Local multiplayer setup

### ✨ Improvements Made

- Old: Could generate confusing codes like `0ILO`, `1I1L`
- New: Clear codes like `K3H7`, `M9PQ` (excludes 0, 1, I, L, O)

**Server Features:**
- Health check at root URL
- Stats endpoint for monitoring
- Production-ready CORS
- Better error handling

**Build System:**

## 🐛 Common Issues

### Build Fails on Netlify
```bash
✅ Check Node version (should be 18+)
✅ Clear cache and redeploy
✅ Check build logs for specific error
```

### Can't Connect to Server
```bash
✅ Server URL in Netlify env vars?
✅ Server running? (check Render dashboard)
✅ Wait 60 seconds if server was sleeping
✅ Check browser console for CORS errors
```

### Game Works Locally, Not in Production
```bash
✅ Environment variable set correctly?
✅ Server URL uses HTTPS (not HTTP)?
✅ Check browser console for errors
✅ Verify server health endpoint responds
```
