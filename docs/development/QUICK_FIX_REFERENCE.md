# ðŸŽ¯ Quick Fix Reference Guide

## Critical Fixes Applied

### 1. Timer Not Resetting Between Phases
**Problem:** Timer stuck on old value when transitioning game â†’ debate â†’ voting  
**Solution:** Added `useEffect` with `initialTime` dependency  
**File:** `src/components/Timer.jsx`

### 2. Vote Tallying Race Condition
**Problem:** 12 simultaneous votes = 12 setTimeout calls = chaos  
**Solution:** Single timeout after all votes, clear previous timeouts  
**File:** `server/index.js` (vote handler)

### 3. XSS Vulnerability
**Problem:** User can inject `<script>` tags in nicknames/chat/answers  
**Solution:** Created sanitization utilities, sanitize all inputs  
**Files:** `src/utils/sanitize.js`, `server/utils/sanitize.js`

### 4. No Error Boundaries
**Problem:** React error = blank screen, no recovery  
**Solution:** Created ErrorBoundary component with reset options  
**File:** `src/components/ErrorBoundary.jsx`

### 5. Infinite Loop Risk
**Problem:** `while(rooms.has(code))` could loop forever  
**Solution:** Added 100-attempt limit with error fallback  
**File:** `server/index.js` (createRoom)

### 6. Auto-Advance Too Fast
**Problem:** Server moved to debate after first answer  
**Solution:** Wait for all human players before advancing  
**File:** `server/index.js` (submitAnswer)

### 7. Null Vote Issues
**Problem:** `voteCounts[null]++` creates undefined keys  
**Solution:** Filter null votes before tallying  
**File:** `server/index.js` (tallyVotesAndScore)

### 8. Avatar Index Overflow
**Problem:** MockSocket avatar assignment could exceed 11  
**Solution:** Proper filtering with fallback to random  
**File:** `src/services/MockSocket.js` (addBot)

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Start server
cd server
npm start

# Start client (separate terminal)
npm run dev

# Open multiple browser windows to test multiplayer
# Try:
# - Let timers expire (verify reset)
# - All players vote at once (verify single tally)
# - Enter <script> in nickname (verify sanitization)
# - Cause error (verify ErrorBoundary)
```
