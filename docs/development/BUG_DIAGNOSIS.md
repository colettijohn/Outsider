## üìä Current Status Check

Let me verify what's working:

1. **Is the dev server running?**
   - Look for: `Local: http://localhost:3001/`
   - If not running, start it: `npm run dev`

2. **Can you access the home screen?**
   - Go to: http://localhost:3001
   - Should see the Outsider logo

3. **Can you open admin panel?**
   - Press `Shift + A`
   - Enter password: `0`
   - Should see navigation buttons

4. **What happens when you click "‚ö° Quick Ritual"?**
   - Does the screen change?
   - Do you see the Oracle?
   - Any errors?
