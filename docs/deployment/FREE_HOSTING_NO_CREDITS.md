## 🖥️ Backend: Keep Using Render Free

Render's free tier is actually great:
- ✅ Never expires
- ✅ No credit card needed
- ✅ 750 hours/month free
- ✅ Auto-deploys from GitHub

**The only downside:** Sleeps after 15 min (wakes in 30s)

### How to minimize sleep impact:
1. Use a free uptime monitor (keeps it awake)
2. Or accept the 30s wake time (first player waits)

---

## 🔥 Alternative: GitHub Pages (Even Simpler!)

### Super Fast Setup:

1. **Install gh-pages:**
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev gh-pages
   ```

2. **Add to package.json:**
   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "predeploy": "npm run build",
     "deploy": "gh-pages -d dist"
   },
   "homepage": "https://colettijohn.github.io/Outsider"
   ```

3. **Deploy:**
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

**Done!** Your game is live at: `https://colettijohn.github.io/Outsider`

## 💡 Keep Backend Awake (Free Services)

Since Render free tier sleeps, use these to keep it awake:

### Option 1: UptimeRobot (Recommended)
1. Go to https://uptimerobot.com (free)
2. Add your Render URL
3. Ping every 5 minutes
4. Your backend never sleeps! ✅

### Option 2: Cron-job.org
1. Go to https://cron-job.org (free)
2. Create job: ping your backend every 10 min
3. Done!

### Option 3: Your Own Ping Script (Free on GitHub Actions)
```yaml
# .github/workflows/keep-alive.yml
name: Keep Backend Awake
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '*/10 * * * *'  # Every 10 minutes
jobs:
  ping:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: curl https://your-backend.onrender.com/health
